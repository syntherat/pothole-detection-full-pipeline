   - **Option B**: Use the GUI's "Select Model" button to load any `.pt` file
   - **Option C**: Train your own (see Training section below)

---

## 💻 Usage

### GUI Application (Recommended)

```bash
python app/main_enhanced.py
```

**How to use:**
1. Click **"Upload Image"** to select a road image
2. Adjust **confidence threshold** slider (default: 35%)
3. Click **"Detect Potholes"** to run detection
4. View annotated results with bounding boxes and statistics
5. Results are automatically saved to `app/output/`

### Batch Image Processing

Process multiple images at once:

```bash
python scripts/predict_script.py --input ./input --output ./output --conf 0.35
```

Options:
- `--input`: Input directory containing images
- `--output`: Output directory for annotated images
- `--conf`: Confidence threshold (0.0-1.0)

### Video Processing

Process video files:

```bash
python scripts/predict_videos.py
```

The script will process all videos in the `input/` directory and save results to `output/videos/`

## 🏋️ Training Your Own Model

### Using Quick Start (Windows)

```bash
quick_start.bat
```

This automated script will:
1. Organize your dataset
2. Train a YOLOv11-small model with baseline hyperparameters
3. Evaluate performance
4. Generate prediction examples

### Manual Training

**Step 1: Prepare Your Dataset**

Place your annotated images in `data/raw/`:
- `data/raw/images/` - Road images
- `data/raw/annotations/` - VOC XML format annotations

Then organize the dataset:

```bash
python scripts/organize_dataset.py
```

This creates a proper train/val/test split (70/15/15) in YOLO format.

**Step 2: Train a Model**

```bash
# Train with default settings (small model, baseline hyperparameters)
python scripts/train_model.py --model small --hyperparams baseline

# Train all model sizes for comparison
python scripts/train_model.py --all

# Custom training
python scripts/train_model.py --model medium --hyperparams aggressive --epochs 150
```

**Model Options:**
- `nano`: Fastest inference (~2ms), good for embedded systems
- `small`: Balanced speed/accuracy (~5ms), recommended
- `medium`: Highest accuracy (~15ms), best for server deployment

**Hyperparameter Presets:**
- `baseline`: Standard training, good for most cases
- `aggressive`: Heavy augmentation, prevents overfitting
- `conservative`: Light augmentation, good for small datasets

Results are saved to `training_results/pothole_<model>_<preset>_<timestamp>/`

**Step 3: Evaluate Performance**

```bash
python scripts/evaluate_model.py
```

Generates comprehensive metrics:
- mAP@0.5 and mAP@0.5:0.95
- Precision and Recall curves
- Confusion matrix
- Per-class performance

## 🎨 Two-Stage Detection (Advanced)

Reduce false positives by first detecting road surfaces, then finding potholes only on roads.

**Step 1: Download Road Segmentation Model**

```bash
python scripts/download_road_model.py
```

**Step 2: Test on Your Data**

```bash
python scripts/test_road_segmentation.py
```

Check the output in `output/road_seg_test/` to verify the road segmentation works well.

**Step 3: Use Two-Stage Detector**

```python
from app.two_stage_detection import create_two_stage_detector

detector = create_two_stage_detector(
    pothole_model_path="model/best.pt",
    road_model_path="model/road_seg.pt"
)

results = detector.detect_potholes(image, conf=0.35)
annotated = detector.visualize(image, results, show_mask=True)
```

## 📊 Model Performance

Performance metrics vary significantly based on dataset quality, size, and diversity. Below are typical ranges for YOLO models on pothole detection:

| Model | Size | Speed (ms) | mAP@0.5 | Precision | Recall |
|-------|------|------------|---------|-----------|--------|
| YOLOv11n | 2.6MB | 1-2 | 55-70% | 60-75% | 50-65% |
| YOLOv11s | 9.4MB | 2-4 | 60-75% | 65-80% | 55-70% |
| YOLOv11m | 20MB | 5-8 | 65-80% | 70-85% | 60-75% |

*Speed benchmarks on NVIDIA RTX 4060. Your results will vary based on:*
- *Dataset size and quality (lighting, angles, pothole variety)*
- *Annotation accuracy and consistency*  
- *Training hyperparameters and epochs*
- *Class balance (number of pothole examples)*

**Tip:** Well-annotated datasets with 2000+ diverse examples typically achieve the higher end of these ranges.

## 📝 Dataset Format

The application supports two annotation formats:

**VOC XML Format** (for raw data):
```xml
<annotation>
  <object>
    <name>pothole</name>
    <bndbox>
      <xmin>100</xmin>
      <ymin>150</ymin>
      <xmax>200</xmax>
      <ymax>250</ymax>
    </bndbox>
  </object>
</annotation>
```

**YOLO Format** (auto-converted):
```
0 0.425 0.512 0.156 0.178
```
Format: `class_id center_x center_y width height` (all normalized 0-1)

**Made with ❤️ for safer roads**

- **Model**: YOLOv11 (ultralytics)
- **Input**: Images (any standard format: JPG, PNG, BMP, etc.)
- **Output**: Bounding boxes with confidence scores
- **Classes**: Single class - "pothole"
- **Confidence Range**: 0.10 - 0.90 (adjustable in GUI)

## Configuration

### Confidence Threshold
- Controls detection sensitivity
- **Lower values** (0.10-0.35): More detections, higher false positives
- **Higher values** (0.60-0.90): Fewer detections, higher confidence
- **Recommended**: Start at 0.35-0.50

### Road ROI Mask
- Use the ROI mask to ignore roadside areas (trees, bushes) in both GUI and video runs
- Ratios are 0..1 and define a rectangle: left/right/top/bottom
- If you still see false positives, add more negative examples (roadsides with no potholes) to training data

### Custom Model

To use a different trained model:

1. Click **"Select Model .pt"** in the GUI
2. Or modify code to load from a specific path:
   ```python
   load_model("/path/to/your/model.pt")
   ```

## Output Files

Detection results are saved in `app/output/` with naming format:
```
pred_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_imagename.jpg
```

Each output includes:
- Original image with bounding boxes
- Detection statistics logged to `pothole_detection.log`

## Logging

Logs are saved to `pothole_detection.log` with:
- Timestamp
- Log level (INFO, ERROR, DEBUG)
- Detailed operation information

Example log output:
```
2025-02-03 10:30:45,123 - utils - INFO - Running detection on: test_image.jpg
2025-02-03 10:30:46,456 - utils - INFO - Detection complete: 3 potholes found (avg confidence: 0.87)
```

## Performance Metrics

Typical performance on standard hardware:
- **Inference Time**: 50-200ms per image (depends on image size)
- **GPU Acceleration**: Automatically used if available (CUDA/Metal)
- **CPU Mode**: Falls back automatically if GPU unavailable

## Troubleshooting

### "Model not found" Error
- Ensure `model/best.pt` exists
- Use "Select Model .pt" button to load a trained model
- Check file permissions

### "Failed to read image" Error
- Ensure image is in valid format (JPG, PNG, BMP)
- Try with a different image
- Check file is not corrupted

### Slow Detection
- Try GPU mode (requires CUDA/Metal)
- Reduce image resolution before uploading
- Check system resources

### Import Errors
- Reinstall dependencies: `pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt`
- Consider using a virtual environment

## Future Enhancements (for car integration)

- [ ] Real-time video stream processing from car camera
- [ ] GPS coordinate logging of detected potholes
- [ ] Driver alert system (audio/visual warnings)
- [ ] Pothole severity classification
- [ ] Network transmission to cloud database
- [ ] Map integration for pothole location tracking

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- 4GB RAM (8GB+ recommended)
- GPU optional but recommended (NVIDIA CUDA 11.8+ for acceleration)
- 500MB+ disk space for model
